generations:
  - name: "First Generation (N60)"
    start_year: 1984
    end_year: 1989
    description: "The first-generation Toyota 4Runner essentially began as a modified Toyota pickup truck (Hilux) with a fiberglass shell covering the bed and rear seats added, evolving Toyota's presence in the growing sport utility vehicle market. Available initially only as a two-door model with a removable fiberglass top over the rear section, the original 4Runner featured a solid front axle and leaf spring suspension emphasizing off-road capability over on-road comfort. Engine options in the US market included a 2.4-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine (22R, later the fuel-injected 22RE) and, briefly, a 2.4-liter turbodiesel option, paired with either manual or automatic transmissions and part-time four-wheel drive with a two-speed transfer case. The interior was spartan by modern standards, with basic amenities and a utilitarian design reflecting the vehicle's truck-based origins. A notable and controversial feature was the removable rear seat that faced sideways, a configuration that would later be deemed unsafe and discontinued. Throughout its production, the first-generation 4Runner gained additional comfort features and refinements, including an available SR5 package with upgraded interior materials and features. This generation established the 4Runner's reputation for durability and off-road capability, though with significant compromises in terms of on-road comfort, interior space, and safety compared to more car-like SUVs that would later dominate the market."

    start_year: 1990
    end_year: 1995
    description: "The second-generation Toyota 4Runner marked a significant evolution from its pickup-based predecessor, featuring a completely unique body design (though still sharing much of its underpinnings with the Hilux/Pickup). Available in both two-door and four-door configurations, this generation transitioned the model toward greater comfort and versatility while maintaining serious off-road capability. A key mechanical change was the switch from a solid front axle to an independent front suspension on four-wheel drive models, improving on-road handling and ride quality while still providing good off-road articulation. Engine options expanded to include a 2.4-liter four-cylinder and a more powerful 3.0-liter V6, both available with manual or automatic transmissions. All models featured a proper steel roof (no more removable fiberglass top) with either a standard steel roof or an optional power moonroof or removable rear section on some variants. The interior saw significant improvements in design, materials, and features, offering a more car-like environment while maintaining utility with fold-down rear seats for expanded cargo capacity. Safety features improved with the introduction of available anti-lock brakes and four-wheel disc brakes on higher trim levels. The second-generation 4Runner successfully balanced the rugged capability expected of the nameplate with increased refinement and practicality, broadening its appeal beyond the hardcore off-road enthusiasts who embraced the first generation. This model established the 4Runner's position in Toyota's lineup as a versatile SUV suitable for both daily driving and weekend adventures."

  - name: "Third Generation (N180)"
    start_year: 1996
    end_year: 2002
    description: "The third-generation Toyota 4Runner continued the model's evolution toward increased refinement and versatility while maintaining its reputation for off-road capability and durability. Featuring a more aerodynamic exterior design with smoother lines and a more integrated appearance compared to the boxy previous generations, this model grew in size, offering increased interior space for passengers and cargo. Mechanically, the third-generation 4Runner retained a body-on-frame construction but switched all models to independent front suspension for improved on-road handling and comfort. Engine options initially included a 2.7-liter four-cylinder and a 3.4-liter V6, both offering improved power and efficiency compared to their predecessors, paired with either manual or automatic transmissions and two-wheel or four-wheel drive. Interior quality saw significant improvements with more car-like amenities, improved noise insulation, and available features including power windows, locks, and seating, premium audio, and leather upholstery on higher trim levels. Safety features expanded to include dual front airbags, available ABS, and improved crash protection through a reinforced body structure. Toyota's off-road technology advanced with this generation, introducing features like Active Traction Control (A-TRAC) and optional rear differential lockers on some variants, enhancing the vehicle's capability in challenging terrain while making it more accessible to drivers of varying skill levels. Positioned between the smaller RAV4 and the larger Land Cruiser, the third-generation 4Runner found success by balancing everyday usability with weekend adventure capability, appealing to families, outdoor enthusiasts, and anyone seeking a durable, versatile SUV."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (N210)"

    end_year: 2009
    description: "The fourth-generation Toyota 4Runner represented a significant redesign, growing larger and more powerful while introducing more sophisticated technology and comfort features. Exterior styling became more aggressive and angular, with pronounced fender flares, a bold front fascia, and an overall more imposing presence. Based on Toyota's new 4×4 platform shared with the Land Cruiser Prado (and Lexus GX), this generation featured a stronger, more rigid frame and updated suspension geometry for improved handling both on and off-road. Engine options in the North American market included a standard 4.0-liter V6 producing 245 horsepower and an optional 4.7-liter V8 making 270 horsepower, both paired with automatic transmissions—the first time a V8 was offered in the 4Runner. Advanced off-road technology expanded with the introduction of Toyota's Downhill Assist Control (DAC), Hill-start Assist Control (HAC), and a more sophisticated four-wheel drive system with electronic terrain controls on higher trim levels, including a center locking differential on some variants. The interior size increased significantly with more passenger space in all dimensions and expanded cargo capacity, while quality and feature content reached new levels with available amenities including a premium JBL audio system, DVD navigation, leather upholstery, and heated seats. Safety advanced with the addition of side and curtain airbags, electronic stability control, and improved crash structures. During this generation, Toyota positioned the 4Runner more clearly as an off-road capable SUV as consumer preferences began shifting toward more car-like crossovers, setting the stage for the model's continued focus on capability rather than following market trends toward increasingly road-oriented SUVs."
