## Generations

The Toyota 4Runner has gone through six main generations, each building upon its reputation for reliability and off-road capability:

- **First Generation (1984-1989)**: Originally based on the Toyota Hilux pickup truck platform, featuring a removable fiberglass top. Available in both two-door and four-door configurations, it established the 4Runner as a versatile SUV combining utility with off-road capability.

- **Fourth Generation (2003-2009)**: Introduced more sophisticated technology and comfort features, including an optional V8 engine. The addition of advanced off-road systems like Downhill Assist Control (DAC) and Hill-start Assist Control (HAC) enhanced its off-road capabilities.

- **Fifth Generation (2010-2023)**: Focused on maintaining traditional body-on-frame construction while adding modern safety and technology features. Notable for its Multi-Terrain Select system, Crawl Control, and Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) on certain trims.

- **Sixth Generation (2024-present)**: The latest generation features a complete redesign with modernized styling, enhanced technology, and improved off-road capabilities while maintaining its body-on-frame construction.
